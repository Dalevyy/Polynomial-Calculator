# Polynomial-Calculator
A C++ calculator that is able to do polynomial operations.

This was the last program I created in my CS202 class, and it was designed as a program test our ability to work with linked lists without using the included list library in C++. In this program, we store polynomials as objects with each term being stored within a linked list. This allows the program to correctly calculate a resulting program that is outputted to the screen. 

I enjoyed making this program since it was my first time using a data structure outside of an array, and I did not have any trouble understanding how linked lists work. Additionally, I enjoyed the program requiring math knowledge since I haven't written many programs yet that utilized complex math.
