# Polynomial-Calculator
A C++ calculator that is able to do polynomial operations.

This was the last program I created in my CS202 class, and it was designed as a program to test our ability to work with linked lists (without using the included list library in C++). In this program, we store polynomials as objects with each term being stored within a linked list. This will allow the program to correctly calculate a resulting polynomial that will then be outputted to the screen. 

I enjoyed making this program since it was my first time using a data structure outside of arrays and vectors, and I did not have any trouble understanding how linked lists work. This program helped to open my eyes with the different ways I can approach solving a programming problem as I could have chosen to implement this calculator with arrays in order to make it work. I also liked the fact that I needed to use mathematical knowledge to complete this program as I haven't had a program in the past that required a more extensive understanding of math prior.
